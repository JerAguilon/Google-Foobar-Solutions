Finally a problem where the simplest solution had a good enough runtime to pass! To solve this, simply select
elements from index 0 to k  in the list. Add these up, and then shift the window from left to right like so:

 L = {0,1,2,3}, k = 3
 {[0, 1, 2],3} --> {0,[1,2,3]}

 From there, all you need to do is shorten the selected elements to the first k - 1, and do the same process until
 k = 0.
