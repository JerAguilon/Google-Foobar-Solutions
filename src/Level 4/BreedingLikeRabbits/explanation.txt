While finding a solution to the functions is rather simple, there are two factors that complicate matters:
        1) The input is LARGE. 10^25 mandates that we can't use simple ints
        2) Even and odd inputs lead to independent solutions that don't have much
           to do with each other.

The solution to the first issue can be eased with the BigInteger class, similar to the BinaryBunnies challenge. A
helpful heuristic is that n in R(n) will never be larger than the input. The largest input possible is 10^25, so we can
always use that as our upper bound. For efficiency, it would be costly to solve for R(n) from 1 to the input, so instead
we will conduct a binary search. Taking into account the second part, we simply need to conduct a binary search
through the even values and the odd values. If solutions exist in both even and odd spaces, we just return the larger
value.
