# GoogleFoobarSolutions

These are my ongoing solutions to the Google foo.bar challenge (https://www.google.com/foobar/), 
a hidden challenge I ran into while querying programming terms on the search engine. There are
5 levels in total. Each level has the same number of problems (1 problem for level 1, 2 for level 2, ...). 
I have saved my solutions, thought processes, and test code for level 3 and onwards.
