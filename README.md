# GoogleFoobarSolutions

These are my ongoing solutions to the Google foo.bar challenge (https://www.google.com/foobar/), 
a hidden challenge I ran into while searching programming terms on the search engine. There are
5 levels in total, ranging from one to a few programming challenges to complete. I have saved my solutions
for level 2 and onwards.
